>> * Survey Ship allows elevator companies to keep digital records of door entrance measurents during the installation process. 
>> * Elevator companies often pay large fines due to delays caused by incorrect measurements being recorded on site. This app ensures all meassurements given by a building contractor are stored in a centrelised location for ALL the companies sites. Reducing the likely hood of heavy charges due to incorrect measurements the lift company would otherwise be liable for.
